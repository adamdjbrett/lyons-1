title: About
text: Montgomery Lyons, PsyD.
body: I have been training in psychology for over 10 years, and have been a
    licensed clinical psychologist in the state of New York for 2 years.  I have
    worked with most demographics of individuals from early childhood to
    geriatric populations, and have been trained in a variety of therapeutic
    techniques.  The therapeutic approach that I most gravitate toward is
    cognitive behavioral therapy; however, I also utilize the humanistic as well
    as the psychodynamic approach when necessary.  Furthermore, being Native
    American and growing up on the Onondaga Nation has given me a cultural
    awareness and sensitivity that is necessary in this field.  It is my belief
    that the client's needs must always come first and foremost, which has been
    my guiding force in providing psychotherapy and other psychological
    services.  My goal is to empower individuals and provide the necessary
    skills that enable individuals to manage, reduce, and cope with maladaptive
    symptoms in a way that will allow a person to lead their best life.
