intro: The most commonly asked questions people have about therapy.
items:
  - question: Batman. How long will therapy take?
    answer: There is no one size fits all answer to that question.  The short answer
      is that it depends and each treatment plan is individualized.  This is
      based on factors such as the goals that one wants to achieve in therapy,
      the severity of the problem(s), the motivation of the person(s) in
      treatment, etc.  Some people may only require a few sessions while others
      may want and need a much longer duration of treatment depending on the
      issues that are being explored and treated.
  - question: What can I expect to achieve in therapy?
    answer: Each case is different, but one can expect to gain a better
      understanding of the issues that necessitated professional
      intervention.  Person(s) served will learn how thoughts, behaviors, and
      emotions are interconnected as well as how to implement effective coping
      strategies to manage maladaptive symptoms.
  - question: What if I canâ€™t afford your full fee?
    answer: <strong>It must be stated that I do not accept any insurance at this
      time and I am 100% private pay.</strong> In the event that an individual
      cannot afford the fee of service, a sliding scale may be negotiated with
      the clinician in order to figure out a fee that works for both
      parties.  This is based on financial resources of the patient(s), as well
      as need for services by the patient(s).
  - question: Does what we talk about in therapy remain confidential?
    answer: One of the main aspects in the therapeutic process has to do with trust
      and confidentiality.  What one discusses in therapy is confidential and
      cannot be disclosed to others without a signed release by the patient
      allowing the clinician to do so.  However, there are a few exceptions to
      that rule.  One exception is if the patient discloses that he or she is
      planning to harm themselves or others.  Another exception is if the
      patient discloses that there is any child or elder abuse occurring.  The
      final exception is if a judge court orders the clinician to provide
      information.
