      desc: Working with the geriatric population has allowed me to gain a better
        knowledge and understanding of how to assist individuals who are dealing

    - title: McLean Hospital
      year: 9/2018––9/2019
      desc: During this fellowship I learned a lot about how substance use and mental
        illness are intertwined, and the most important lesson that I took away
        from this experience is that there is no one “correct” approach because
        each case is unique and as such the treatment plans that created the
        best outcomes must be tailored to each unique individual.

    - title: Brockton Area Multi Services (BAMSI)
      year: 8/2016––6/2018
      desc: Working with individuals who have traumatic brain injuries and cognitive
        disabilities have a tremendous impact on their mental health status, and
        because of that factor group therapies and treatments for these
        individuals must be adjusted and tailored in order to fit their needs to
        achieve the best outcome.  I also learned how provide neuropsychological
        assessments for this population navigating their impairments due to
        traumatic brain injury and/or lower cognitive functioning.

        facilitate group therapy to not only individuals with mental illness,
        but also to individuals who were suffering from substance use issues
        combined with mental health issues.

        experiencing substance use issues and experience every part of the
        process.  I learned how effective treatment encompassed treating the
        whole individual in all aspects of their life, not just the substance
        use issue.
