Utilize Cognitive Behavioral Treatment approach by examining thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are maladaptive and impact functioning.  The client will learn and utilize effective coping skills and work on changing maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as necessary.  I take a holistic approach and hope to achieve balance in a personâ€™s life so the three domains that I focus on are mind, body, and spirit.
