This disorder is categorized by extreme highs (mania) and extreme lows (depression), and I use an individualized approach for each case that I see since no case is ever the same.  I pull from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), humanistic approaches, as well as holistic modalities when treating bipolar issues.  We will identify signs, symptoms, triggers and stressors during sessions, and utilize other strategies to manage/reduce maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
