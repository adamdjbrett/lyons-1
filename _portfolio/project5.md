Trauma is very complicated and the experiences and factors surrounding those experiences are unique to each individual; therefore, each treatment plan will be unique for that particular client.  I typically may incorporate **EMDR** (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), exposure therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and if necessary refer the client for medication management.
