â€¢	For interpersonal conflict I tend to gravitate toward Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and work on issues that include, but are not limited to the following: emotion management/regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, mindfulness. Effective communication skills, as well as examining issues around trust, resentment, and anger.
