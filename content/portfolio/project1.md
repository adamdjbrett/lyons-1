The goal is to first identify the underlying causes for a person’s substance use behaviors in order to understand how and why they have come to this point.  Once established, I use an individualized approach that incorporates collaboration with the person’s needs and goals in order to develop a treatment plan specifically tailored to the individual that will best serve them in achieving their goals and meeting their needs.  I believe in a holistic approach and work to develop sustainable balance in the areas of mind, body, and spirit.
